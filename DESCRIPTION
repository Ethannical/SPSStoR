Title: Convert SPSS Syntax to R Syntax
Description: It is common for users to have syntax or inherit syntax from different 
    statistical programming languages. If a user is not proficient in that language,
    it is helpful to convert the syntax into a syntax that is more familiar. The benefits
    are that the user can better understand the syntax to implement. Another advantage is 
    for new users of R that have working SPSS code to compare the converted syntax.
